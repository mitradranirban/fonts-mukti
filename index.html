<h2>Mukti
Version 3 Release notes </h2>
<p>by <b>Dr Anirban Mitra </b>
</p>
<p>TL;DR: Mukti Open Source OpenType Bengali Font Version 3.0 with
lots of new features is out and is avalable for download at <a href="https://github.com/mitradranirban/fonts-mukti">
github site</a>
</p>
<p>Long Post Ahead 
</p>
<p>Way back in 2002, I got interested in Digital Typography, mainly in
order to produce a font to view Bangla Documents in my Windows 98 PC.
In the process I came in contact with other members of Free Bangla
Font Project like Sayamindu and Deepayan and with their help made 4
fonts, Ani, MitraMono, Mukti and Mukti Narrow. Mukti had to be
withdrawn due to copywrite issues with the base glyphs, (which
resembled Linotype Bengali, which were later used by Microsoft and
Monotype to create Sonar Bangla font for Windows). However,
MuktiNarrow was well appreciated and was used by Ankur Project as
default UI font when they came out with AnkurOs, world's first
operating system with a Bangla user interface. Even now version 0.94
of Mukti Narrow is available with Bengali pack of all Debian based Linux distros. 
I wrote about this experience in an article in <a href="https://opensource.com/article/20/7/linux-bengali">Opensource.com</a></p>
<p>When Corona Pandemic drastically reduced patients in my chamber, I
thought of using some of the free time to upgrade the font, now
renamed only Mukti. Previous two such attempts in 2006 with version
1.99 and in 2015 with version 2.01 resulted in appearance of more
bugs than usefullness mainly due to hastiness with which I did it.
Moreover the reluctance of indic group of Debian to incorporate the
newer version in stead of the old one also damped my morale. This
time however I took my time and tried to remove as much bugs as
possible with introduction of newer features .</p>
<p>Here are the most important changes in Mukti Version 3.0 compared
to MuktiNarrow 0.94 </p>
<p><b>1. Shift to Open Source editor:</b> - MuktiNarrow was developed using
FontCreatorProgram and Microsoft VOLT in Windows98. Mukti is
re-edited in open source font editor Fontforge in Ubuntu Linux. Now I
can proudly say No non-free/ closed source programs are used in
creating the font.</p>

<br/>

<p><b> 2, Change in Technical details :-</b> Alongwith change in editors
the EM of the font is changed from 2048 to 1000 and the curves are
saved as cubic bezier which are converted to quadratic during
production of ttf fonts.</p>
<br/>

<p><b>3. Upgrade to Unicode 14.0 standard </b>- MuktiNarrow was created at
times when Unicode version 4.0 was in vogue. A few characters are
added in Bengali block since then, notably Khanda Ta, Abbreviation
mark etc . They are added in the font.</p>

<br/>

<p><b> 4. Shift from Version 1 to Version 2 of Bengali OpenType Font specification :- </b> This required complete
			overhauling of the OpenType GSUB tables. However it will help in
			proper postioning of reph and left sided matras in case an conjuct
			is absent in font.

<br/>

	<p>	 <b>5.Support for Assamese language</b> Assamese / Ahamia specific forms which was absent in Mukti Narrow is added in this version</p>

			</p>
<br/>

</p>
<br/>
	<p><b>6. Support for both traditional and modern form of conjucts:- </b> Alternate modern "schoolbook" forms are are available as Stylistic alternate </p>
		<p><img src="pics/salt.png" name="AlternateConjunct"/>

<br/>

<p><b>7. Addition of Vedic stress Marks:- </b> Vedic Stress marks to indicate voice modulation for writing
Vedic hymns in Bangla as well as musical notations are added in the font.
</p>
<p ><img src="pics/vedic.png" alt="vedic-marks"/></p>
<br/>

<p><b>8. Addition of autohinting by Fontforge:-</b> It will make the font look
crisper in small points in screen compared to MuktiNarrow which was not hinted and Antialiased in all sizes. 
</p>
<p><b>9. Removal of Latin glyphs:- </b> Latin glyphs sourced from GNU-Unifont was added
to MuktNarrow as it was a necessary condtion to be able to use and edit the font in Windows 98 platform which did not support pure Unicode font. As modern operating systems accept pure unicode fonts, latin glyphs are removed from the font </p>
<br/>
<p><b>10. Addition of few new conjuncts </b> - as per juktakshar list  </p>
<p>
	<b>11. Removal of references and overlapping </b> Instead of forming conjuncts as combination of reference of component glyphs, conjuntcs are formed after removing overlap between component glyphs so that white area does not appear in large point sizes. 
</p>
<p><img src="pics/deref.png" alt="remove-reference"/> </p>
</p>and 
12. Various bugfixes  </p>
<br/>
<p> The font is now licenced under GPL3+ with font exeption</p>
