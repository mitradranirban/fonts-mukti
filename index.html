<h2>Mukti
Version 3 Release notes </h2>
<p>by Dr Anirban Mitra 
</p>
<p>TL;DR: Mukti Open Source OpenType Bengali Font Version 3.0 with
lots of new features is out and is avalable for download at <a href="https://github.com/mitradranirban/fonts-mukti">
github site</a>
</p>
<p>Long Post Ahead 
</p>
<p>Way back in 2002, I got interested in Digital Typograph, mainly is
order to produce a font to view Bangla Documents in my Windows 98 PC.
In the process I came in contact with other members of Free Bangla
Font Project like Sayamindu and Deepayan and with their help made 4
fonts, Ani, MitraMono, Mukti and Mukti Narrow. Mukti had to be
withdrawn due to copywrite issues with the base glyphs, (which
belonged to Linotype Bengali, which were later used by Microsoft and
Monotype to createSonar Bangla font for Windows). However,
MuktiNarrow was well appreciated and was used by Ankur Project as
default UI font when they came out with AnkurOs, world's first
operating system with a Bangla user interface. Even now version 0.94
of Mukti Narrow is available with Bengali pack of all Debian and
Fedora based Linux distros. I wrote about my journey in an article in
https://opensource.com/2020/Nov/Linux/bengali</p>
<p>When Corona Pandemic drastically reduced patients in my chamber, I
thought of using some of the free time to upgrade the font, now
renamed only Mukti. Previous two such attempts in 2006 with version
1.99 and in 2015 with version 2.01 resulted in appearance of more
bugs than usefullness mainly due to hastiness with which I did it.
Moreover the reluctance of indic group of Debian to incorporate the
newer version in stead of the old one also damped my morale. This
time however I took my time and tried to remove as much bugs as
possible with introduction of newer features .</p>
<p>Here are the most important changes in Mukti Version 3.0 compared
to MuktiNarrow 0.94 </p>
<p><b>1. Shift to Open Source editor:</b> - MuktiNarrow was developed using
FontCreatorProgram and Microsoft VOLT in Windows98. Mukti is
re-edited in open source font editor Fontforge in Ubuntu Linux. Now I
can proudly say No non-free/ closed source programs are used in
creating the font.</p>
<br/>

<p>2, Change in tecnical matrix:- As a result of change in editors
the EM of the font is changed from 2048 to 1000 and the curves are
saved as cubic bezier which are converted to quadratic during
production of ttf.</p>
<br/>

<p><b>3. Upgrade to Unicode 14.0 standard </b>- MuktiNarrow was created at
times when Unicode version 4.0 was in vogue. A few characters are
added in Bengali block since then, notably Khanda Ta, Abbreviation
mark etc . They are added in the font.</p>

<br/>

<p><b> 4. Shift from Version 1 to Version 2 of Bengali OpenType Font specification :- </b> This required complete
			overhauling of the OpenType GSUB tables. However it will help in
			proper postioning of reph and left sided matras in case an conjuct
			is absent in font.
